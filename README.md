# SynacorChallenge
OSCON 2012 Synacor Challenge by Eric Wastl

Before the venerable tradition of the yearly Advent Of Code (http://adventofcode.com/),
there was this programmer's puzzle by the same author.<br><br>
Even in those early days, the challenge was already so sophisticated as to be *tailored* to each participant :
although the general rules are the same for everyone, the task details are individually tweaked.<br><br>
I started from this participant's copy : https://github.com/Aneurysm9/vm_challenge/blob/main/challenge.bin
but there are other copies in archives online, like https://github.com/surgi1/synacorchallenge/blob/main/challenge.bin<br><br>
The Teleport challenge can be easily bypassed (by writing Nop-codes over the call to the verification function),
but by spending the effort to use the proper Teleporter setting, a matching display code can be obtained.
This makes my 7th display code match those of https://github.com/Aneurysm9/vm_challenge/blob/main/README.md
but weirdly, the 8th code upon completion still does *not* match.
