# SynacorChallenge
OSCON 2012 Synacor Challenge by Eric Wastl

Before the venerable tradition of the yearly Advent Of Code (http://https://adventofcode.com/),
there was this programmer's puzzle by the same author.
Even in those early days, the challenge was already so sophisticated as to be *tailored* to each participant :
although the general rules are the same for everyone, the task details are individually tweaked.
I have started from this participant's copy : https://github.com/Aneurysm9/vm_challenge/blob/main/challenge.bin
